INTRODUCTION                                                             *pss*

This plugin is a front for pss.

:Pss[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                               *:Pss*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:PssFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:PssFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

MAPPINGS                                                        *pss-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

o                   open file (same as enter).
go                  preview file (open but maintain focus on pss.vim results).
t                   open in a new tab.
T                   open in new tab silently.
v                   open in vertical split.
gv                  open in vertical split silently.
q                   close the quickfix window.
